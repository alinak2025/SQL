--For this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database to get information about items sold at the store.

--wrote a query to order the items by price: 
SELECT item_name, price 
FROM superstore 
ORDER BY price DESC; 

--wrote a query that shows a statistic about item prices: 
SELECT MIN(price) 
FROM superstore; 

--wrote a query that displays a statistic about item prices in the category of "Kitchen Supplies":
SELECT SUM(price)
FROM superstore
WHERE category = "Kitchen Supplies";

--wrote a query that shows which items have an average rating of 4.5 and higher:
SELECT item_name,average_rating
FROM superstore
WHERE average_rating>=4.5
ORDER BY average_rating DESC;

-=wrote a query that orders the quantity of items in the category of "Furnishings"
SELECT item_name, stock_quantity
FROM superstore
WHERE category = "Furnishings"
ORDER BY stock_quantity DESC;

--wrote a query that displays the highest price of items in the category of "Appliances" 
SELECT MAX(price)
FROM superstore
WHERE category = "Appliances"; 

--wrote a query that shows the quantity of air purifiers in stock 
SELECT stock_quantity 
FROM superstore
WHERE item_name = "Air Purifier";
